"""
the 2 inputs it should work on is latex code and string. 
it should be able to check if the solver is applicable
 (e.g., if there is = or >= or <= etc.), then output if there is probably an error or not.
take note that the latex code may not be mathematically right 
e.g. fraction can be frac{}{234} and still be parsed. 
for such instances, the code should determine that it cannot determine if its right or not
