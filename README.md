Math Handwriting Recognition 


Data description 
The dataset consists of scanned tutorial worksheets from ST2131/MA2216 tutorials from some years 
back. The names and matriculation numbers have been redacted. The worksheets consist of 
handwritten answers to probability questions. 

Problem statement 
To develop an interface/system that can assist with grading handwritten math questions. The interface 
could be for the students, or for the instructors who are grading. 

Persona 
Asoka is a 53-year old professor from the Department of Statistics. She has been teaching courses that 
involve proofs (e.g. probability, math-stat) for 25 years. Teaching is her passion, but as class sizes 
become bigger, she feels she has to sacrifice handwritten assessments for MCQs due to grading time, to 
the detriment of the learning experience and quality to students. 

Final Presentation Videos 
The front end team should present their product to the faculty member grading (e.g. Asoka) 
The modeling team should target the presentation to fellow data scientists. 

Additional Information 
1. https://github.com/falvaro/seshat  
a. This repository is for a handwriting parser (it does not work that well, but the paper and 
the code are good starting points). 
2. https://mathpix.com/  
a. A commercial software for recognising math handwriting 
3. https://github.com/DPRL/CROHME_2014  
a. CROHME stands for Competition on Recognition of Handwritten Mathematical 
Expressions. This repository contains code for one of the entries for the 2014 
competition. (Look for others!) 
4. Although the data is provided in pdf format, this is not ideal, and you may want to use some 
other language/software that captures the order of the strokes e.g MathML or Xournal++
