. The chess clubs of two schools consist of, respectively, 8 and 9 players. Four members from each club
are randomly chosen to participate in a contest between the two schools. The chosen players from
one team are then randomly paired with those from the other team, and each pairing plays a game of
chess. Suppose that Rebecca and her sister Elise are on the chess clubs at different schools. What is
the probability that

(a) Rebecca and Elise will be paired?
(b) Rebecca and Elise will be chosen to represent their schools but will not play each other?
(c) either Rebecca or Elise (but not both) will be chosen to represent their school?
